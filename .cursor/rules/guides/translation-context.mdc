# Translation Context Rule

## Purpose

This rule ensures that all translation strings in the JSON files have clear and accurate context. This context aids AI translation tools in providing more accurate translations.


## Instructions

1. **Analyze the String Identifier**: Extract context from the string identifier. For example, `gs.header.search` indicates that the string is part of the global header and relates to a search function.

2. **Review Code Usage**: Search the codebase to understand how and where the string is used. This helps in understanding the functional context.

3. **Analyze Surrounding Strings**: If the string is part of a series, identify the other strings it interacts with. This helps in understanding its role in the sentence or phrase.

4. **Combine Contexts**: Write a comprehensive `comment` by combining insights from the identifier, code usage, and surrounding strings. Ensure it is clear, concise, and informative. **Review existing comments and update them if they are outdated or incorrect. Comments should never be empty.**

5. **Update JSON File**: Add or update the `comment` in the JSON file for each string, ensuring that no comment is left empty.


## Examples
- **Identifier**: `gs.header.search`
  - **Context**: "Global header: Label for the search button in the application's global header, used to open the search menu."

- **Identifier**: `gs.date.at`
  - **Context**: "Date and time expression: Used to indicate a specific time, e.g., 'Meeting at 3 PM'."


## Testing and Validation
- Review translations to ensure they align with the intended meaning.
- Get feedback from translators to improve context descriptions.
- Consider localization nuances to avoid common translation pitfalls.

## File Editing Restrictions

- **Edit Only `en-US.json` Files**: Ensure that only `en-US.json` files are manually edited. These files are the source for translations and should contain the most accurate and up-to-date context.

- **Do Not Edit Localized Files**: Files such as `en-GB.json` are generated by a third-party tool and should not be manually edited. Any changes to these files should be made through the appropriate translation management system.

-   To start the development run the `{{packageManager}} run start` command.

## Quick Introduction

By default, this project uses the [GoodData.Cloud](https://sdk.gooddata.com/gooddata-ui/docs/cloud_introduction.html) powered anonymous public proxy and workspace with the demo data,
so you can quickly start hacking with [GoodData.UI](https://sdk.gooddata.com/gooddata-ui).

It's lightweight as possible, but ready to be extended, connected to your own data and used on production later.

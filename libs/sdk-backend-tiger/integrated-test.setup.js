 * Cookie domain rewriting - this patching is in place because Wiremock standalone does not support cookie
 * rewriting. It is possible through its programmatic API but that would mean we cannot use the 3rd party
 * standalone docker image.
 *
 * Thus, wiremock running on localhost returns platform's cookies with Domain=secure... but trying to add that
 * into the cookie-jar will bomb (Cookie not for current host's domain).
 *
 * So.. one way to go around this is to do rewriting on client side - while processing the request:
 *
 * -  monkey-patch the https module (all communication is through https, never http)
 * -  before sending request to real https, add Domain=secure...; to the Cookie (if any)
 * -  create the real request
 * -  instrument it with response listener that will be stripping Domain=secure...' from set-cookie
 * -  return the request
 *
 * This is transparent to the node-fetch that is used by the api-client.

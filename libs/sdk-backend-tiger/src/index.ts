 * getting and creating metadata objects, running executions, getting settings, getting available workspaces, and more.

     * Execution normalization is applied by default for tiger. This is so that tiger does not have to support
     * questionable mechanics of measure name and format assignment and attribute name assignment; tiger does not
     * accept those parameters on input to AFM.
     *
     * Normalizing decorator takes care of this transparently - it will modify the execution definition under the
     * covers, remove the nonsense and then send the execution to the real tiger impl. Once tiger impl returns data,
     * the decorator will apply denormalization and reinstate the detail it stripped away.
     *
     * IMPORTANT: in order for the decorator to work without issues, it is important that the results provided by the
     * tiger backend match the contracts for result dimension and data view header items. To this end, there are
     * couple of alternations / enrichment of tiger's descriptors and header items. Those are done during
     * conversion. See `src/convertors/fromBackend/dimensions.ts` and `result.ts` in the same dir.
     *
     * NOTE: since tiger does not yet support true execute-by-reference, and instead always falls back to
     * freeform execution of the definition derived from the insight itself, it is all good to use fallback mode
     * in the normalizing backend. However, one day, if tiger supports execute-by-reference, then the normalizing
     * decorator needs to be removed. and instead the logic to restore titles, aliases and formats must be implemented
     * in the various convertors in this package.

# GoodData.UI SDK - Core

This package provides base functionality useful for building [React visualizations](https://sdk.gooddata.com/gooddata-ui/docs/create_new_visualization.html) on top of GoodData.

The functionality includes functions for getting data from the [Analytical Backend](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gooddata/sdk-backend-spi), components and React hooks that serve as building blocks for custom visualizations, visualization definition placeholders, support for drilling, and so on.

See the other `@gooddata/sdk-ui-*` packages (for example, [`@gooddata/sdk-ui-charts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gooddata/sdk-ui-charts)) for pre-built visualizations that you can use instead of building your own.

# Tiger GoodData Platform REST API Client

## Introduction

This package provides a thin REST API Client for the 'tiger' GoodData Platform. The API client is useful for specific,
low-level tasks targeting the platform. It can be used to develop small applications for either browser or the node.js
environment. The responsibilities of the API client are mostly about exposing REST API endpoints as asynchronous function calls.

However, we believe and recommend that the API client should be used as a last resort in situations where the higher-level
components and abstractions are insufficient: please check out the @gooddata/sdk-backend-spi and
@gooddata/sdk-backend-tiger to learn about a more convenient API to work with analytical backends.

> Note: if you are using the API client to drive custom executions on GoodData platform then there is no reason to
> use the API client directly. The

This is Tiger platform API client. Client is generated by [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) using [typescript-axios](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/tree/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/main/resources/typescript-axios) module, from our [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification).

# Client generation example:

`BASE_URL=http://localhost:9005/ USERNAME=username PASSWORD=password npm run generate-client`

Or you can create a `.env` file with the following format

```
USERNAME=username
PASSWORD=password
BASE_URL=http://localhost:9005/
```

and just run `npm run generate-client`. The `.env` file is ignored by git, so don't worry about putting the credentials there.

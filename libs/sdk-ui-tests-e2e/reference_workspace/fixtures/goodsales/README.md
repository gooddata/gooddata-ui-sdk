Extends the existing fixture for:

-   https://github.com/gooddata/gdc-test-fixtures/blob/develop/fixtures/TigerLayout/tiger_goodsales_declarative_layout.json
    metadata objects defined in tiger_metadata_extension.json.

If you need to change datasets, facts and metrics, do that in shared repo.
If you need new MD objects just for AD tests, these will be stored in the metadata extension json here.

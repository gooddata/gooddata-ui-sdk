 * -  Each cache entry contains both the actual query object, information about loading the result and then
 *    the result itself
 * -  The types related to query cache entries are what matters; the reducer and action typings are collateral
 * -  Since the slices are created dynamically and both the slice reducers and slice actions are required by
 *    the outside code, the typings for reducers is needed as well.

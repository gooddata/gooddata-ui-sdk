 *
 * - This must be always the first command that occurs after the drill interaction and must be dispatched before more granular drill commands.
 * - Specific drill commands that can follow this general drill command are: {@link DrillDown}, {@link DrillToInsight}, {@link DrillToDashboard},
 *   {@link DrillToCustomUrl}, {@link DrillToAttributeUrl}, {@link DrillToLegacyDashboard}

/**
 * Notify the dashboard about asynchronous rendering (eg when the component needs to load some asynchronous data to be rendered) of the component.
 *
 * @remarks
 *  * Mechanism is following:
 * - You must request async rendering for at least 1 component within 5 seconds of the {@link DashboardInitialized} event.
 *   (If you do not register any asynchronous rendering, after 5 seconds the dashboard will announce that it is rendered by dispatching {@link DashboardRenderResolved} event.)
 * - You can request async rendering for any number of components. Requests are valid if the first rule is met
 *   and not all asynchronous renderings have been resolved and the maximum timeout (20min by default) has not elapsed.
 * - The component may again request asynchronous rendering within 5 seconds of resolution. Maximum 3x.
 *   (this is necessary to cover possible re-renders caused by data received from the components themselves, after they are rendered)
 * - Maximum rendering time of the dashboard is 20min - if some asynchronous renderings are not yet resolved at this time, {@link DashboardRenderResolved} event is dispatched anyway.
 *
 * - Each component on the dashboard that is rendered asynchronously should fire this command.
 * - Once the component is rendered, it should notify the dashboard by dispatching {@link resolveAsyncRender} command
 *   with the corresponding identifier.
 *
 * By registering and resolving asynchronous data retrieval of the each widget, the dashboard is able to recognize and notify that it is fully rendered.
 * This mechanism is necessary for dashboard exports to PDF to work properly.

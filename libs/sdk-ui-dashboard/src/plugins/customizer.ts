     * Register a factory for attribute filter decorator providers.
     *
     * @remarks
     * Decorators are a way to add customizations or embellishments on top
     * of an existing component. Decorators are more complex to write because they need to work with the component
     * they should decorate and add 'something' on top of that component.
     *
     * This is best illustrated on an example:
     *
     * @example
     * ```
     * withCustomDecorator((next) => {
     *     return (filter) => {
     *         if (some_condition_to_prevent_decoration) {
     *             return undefined;
     *         }
     *
     *         // Make sure you call this outside the component render function,
     *         // otherwise a new instance of the decorated component is created on each re-render.
     *         const Decorated = next(filter);
     *
     *         function MyCustomDecorator(props) {
     *              return (
     *                  <div>
     *                      <p>My Custom Decoration</p>
     *                      <Decorated {...props} />
     *                  </div>
     *              )
     *         }
     *
     *         return MyCustomDecorator;
     *     }
     * })
     * ```
     *
     * The above shows how to register a decorator that will use some condition to determine whether particular
     * attribute filter is eligible for decoration.
     *
     * Note: the factory function that you specify will be called immediately at the registration time. The
     * provider that it returns will be called at render time.
     *
     * @param providerFactory - factory

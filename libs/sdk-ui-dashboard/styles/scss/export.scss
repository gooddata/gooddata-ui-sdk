    // The following fixes export of flexible layouts to work in the most cases.
    // The below are some magic numbers that ensure that widgets at the end of dashboard are
    // usually not cut of and widgets at the end of the nested container do not bleed into the
    // next container/section. For some reason grid items overflow its container. It can be fixed
    // by changing display: grid to display: block/flex on the containers but then the grid nesting
    // is broken. Something is wrong with how the layout is constructed and interpreted by print
    // preview in Chromium. Maybe our grid structure is not clean enough and some flex containers
    // inside the grid tree messes up with it. For now, this is good enough but this needs to be fixed properly.

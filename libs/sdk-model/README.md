# SDK domain models

This package provides domain models for GoodData.UI.

These domain models are backend-agnostic. This makes them reusable across different [Analytical Backend](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gooddata/sdk-backend-spi) implementations.
The package includes TypeScript type definitions, factory functions, functions to get or set certain properties
of the objects in an immutable way, and more. These are used in both the `@gooddata/sdk-backend-*` and `@gooddata/sdk-ui* packages`.

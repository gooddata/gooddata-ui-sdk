This package is a part of the [GoodData.UI SDK](https://sdk.gooddata.com/gooddata-ui/docs/about_gooddataui.html).
To learn more, check [the source monorepo](https://github.com/gooddata/gooddata-ui-sdk).

This package provides various UI components used to build GoodData applications (such as buttons, icons, and so on).

These components are all marked as internal, and we do not recommend using them directly outside of GoodData because their API can change at any time.

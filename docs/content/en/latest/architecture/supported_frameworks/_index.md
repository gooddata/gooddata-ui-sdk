As of now, there is direct support only for [React](../../quick_start/) and [Web Components](../../learn/embed_dashboards/web_components/).

There are no near-future plans to introduce comprehensive documentation for integrating GoodData.UI with any other platforms or frameworks.

However GoodData.UI supports nearly all .js and .ts based applications, altough some of them will require more work. See [Limitations](../architecture_overview/limitations/) to learn about obstacles, that you might encounter when implementing GoodData.UI without frameworks and platforms mentioned below.

We have written a Frontend Integration Series articles that should get you started using some of these other frameworks, if you do not use either React of Web Components:

* [Angular](https://www.gooddata.com/blog/frontend-integration-series-angular/)
* [Next.js](https://www.gooddata.com/blog/frontend-integration-series-nextjs/)
* [Vue.js](https://www.gooddata.com/blog/frontend-integration-series-vue-js/)
* [SvelteKit](https://www.gooddata.com/blog/frontend-integration-series-sveltekit/)

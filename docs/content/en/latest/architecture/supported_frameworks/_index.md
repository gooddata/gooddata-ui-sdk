As of now, there is direct support only for [React](../../quick_start/) and [Angular 9+](./angular/). There are no near-future plans to introduce guides for any other platforms or frameworks.

GoodData.UI also support [Web Components](../../learn/embed_dashboards/web_components/), as we understand, that sometimes, you don't want to use the React, due to the innert complexity it would bring.

{{% alert title="Support of other platforms and frameworks" color="info"%}}
GoodData.UI supports nearly all .js and .ts based applications, altough some of them will require more work.

See [Limitations](../architecture_overview/limitations/) to learn about obstacles, that you might encounter when implementing GoodData.UI without frameworks and platforms mentioned below.

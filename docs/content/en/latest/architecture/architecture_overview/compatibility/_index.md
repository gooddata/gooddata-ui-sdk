## Supported Versions

Different versions of GoodData.UI go through the life cycle phases and they recieve a different level of support depending on what stage of their life cycle they're in.

As a general recommendation, we encourage you to always use the latest available version of GoodData.UI to make the user experience with integrating GoodData.UI as smooth and secure as possible and to ensure that GoodData.UI always uses the latest features of GoodData.

### Life cycle phases

Each version of GoodData.UI goes through the following phases:

1. **General Availability** (GA)
    * **When it starts:** When a major version is publicly released. To get notified about a new version, subscribe to the [Release Notes](https://support.gooddata.com/hc/en-us/sections/203564877).
    * **What it means:** A version in GA is going through active development, receives all new features and bug fixes, which are applied on top of the last minor version.

2. **End-of-Development** (EOD)
    * **When it starts:** When a newer major version is publicly released.
    * **What it means:** A version in EOD receives only security fixes (unless they can be resolved by a SemVer-compatible upgrade) and fixes for critical issues. Only production dependencies receive the security fixes. These fixes are applied on top of the last minor version. No new features are added.

3. **End-of-Support** (EOS)
    * **When it starts:** The date is defined by GoodData.
    * **What it means:** A version in EOS receives neither new features nor bug fixes. No technical support is provided. Although the version is still available on NPM, we do not recommend that you use it.

### GoodData Cloud & GoodData.CN

The GoodData.UI is versioned and usually released in tandem with GoodData Cloud.

We strongly recommend you always work with the newest version of GoodData.UI, and newest GoodData.CN, if you are using this self-deployed version of GoodData.

The following table provides the lifecycle phases of GoodData.UI versions:

| Major Version | Status              | GA              | EOD               | EOS               |

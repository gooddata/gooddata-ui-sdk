GoodData.UI comes with ready-made visual components. You can use these visual components as-is or customize them. You can also use the unique [InsightView](../../learn/visualize_data/insightview/) component that simply renders any chart that you create on the GoodData platform.

This article provides components examples and basic instructions on component usage.

{{% alert %}} All examples in this section showcase the use of the code generated by catalog-export and assume that the application is set up with BackendProvider and WorkspaceProvider as described in [Integrate into and Existing Application](../../learn/integrate_and_authenticate/cn_and_cloud_integration/).

Currently available out-of-the-box visualizations:

| Name | Visual | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Area Chart](./area_chart/) | ![Area Chart](/gd-ui/area_chart.png) |Shows data as an area under a line intersecting dots. Can display multiple measures or a single measure split by one attribute. |
| [Bar Chart](./bar_chart/) | ![Bar Chart](/gd-ui/bar_chart.png) | Horizontal visual commonly used to illustrate trends, comparisons, and distributions. |
| [Bubble Chart](./bubble_chart/) | ![Bubble Chart](/gd-ui/bubble_chart.png) | Shows data as bubbles using Cartesian coordinates. Typically shows three measures for X-axis, Y-axis, and one for the size. |
| [Column Chart](./column_chart/) | ![Column Chart](/gd-ui/column_chart.png) | Shows data in vertical columns. Can display one or multiple measures. |
| [Combo Chart](./combo_chart/) | ![Combo Chart](/gd-ui/combochart.png) | Combines two types of visualizations, usually, a column chart and a line chart. |
| [Donut Chart](./donut_chart/) | ![Donut Chart](/gd-ui/donut_chart.png) | Shows data as proportional segments of a disc with hollowed out center. Can be segmented by either multiple measures or an attribute. |
| [Geo Pushpin Chart](./geo_pushpin_chart/) | ![Bar Chart](/gd-ui/geo_pushpin_chart.png) | Visualizes data broken down by geographic region across an actual map and points the latitude and longitude of locations.|
| [Headline](./headline/) | ![Headline](/gd-ui/headline.png)| Shows a single number or compares two numbers. Unlike KPI Headline can display attributes. |
| [Heatmap](./heatmap/) | ![Heatmap](/gd-ui/heatmap.png) | Represents data as a matrix where individual values are represented as colors. Helps discover trends and understand complex datasets. |
| [KPI](./kpi/) | ![KPI](/gd-ui/KPI.png) | A KPI (Key Performance Indicator) renders a measure calculated by the GoodData platform. |
| [Line Chart](./line_chart/) | ![Line chart](/gd-ui/line_chart.png) | Shows data as line-connected dots. Can display either multiple measures as individual lines or a single measure split by one attribute into multiple lines with points intersecting attribute values. |
| [Pie Chart](./pie_chart/) | ![Pie Chart](/gd-ui/pie_chart.png) | Shows data as proportional segments of a disc. Can be segmented by either multiple measures or an attribute. |
| [Pivot Table](./pivot_table/) | ![Pivot Table](/gd-ui/pivot_table.png) | Expands capabilities of a regular (flat) table by allowing to reorganize and summarize selected data beyond the typical row-column relationship. |
| [Scatter Plot](./scatter_plot/) |![Scatter Plot](/gd-ui/scatter_plot.png) | Shows data as points using Cartesian coordinates. Typically have a minimum of two measures, one for the X-axis and the other for the Y-axis, and one attribute, which determines the meaning of each data point.  |
